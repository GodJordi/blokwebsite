            <h3>It’s not VR.</h3>
            <p>Let’s say you want to see an astronaut. You can do that with Virtual Reality, but it isolates you from the physical world.</p>
            
            <img>
            <h3>It’s not smartphone AR.</h3>
            <p>Augmented Reality can place an astronaut in the physical world. But the whole experience is trapped within a tiny handheld screen.</p>
            
            <img>
            <h3>It’s a spatial computer.</h3>
            <p>With Magic Leap 1, an astronaut can float around your hallway, moonwalk across your coffee table, and seamlessly understand the space it’s in. It can even look you in the eye.</p>
